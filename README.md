# RevolutionCASE
The RevolutionCASE Tool is the result of my master's degree research.
 This project enables the developer to automatically and visually execute structural refactor on a production database. 
 RevolutionCASE has the following features: 
 - Partial Reverse Engineering: the developer brings to the canvas only the concerning tables to refactor 
 - Modeling Language: using a unique language to model both relational and refactoring, the RevolutionCASE tool delivers simple constructors and properties to set up and run the refactoring quickly 
- Script Generation or Forward Engineering: It's up to the developer whether he wants to run the refactoring straight from the tool or copy the script from the Script View
* It worth note that all refactorings, as well as the research that inspired this tool, was based on Pramod Sadalage's book Refactoring Databases : Evolutionary Database Design

## How to Download and Use
You can download the tool [here](https://github.com/profgenesislima/revolutiocase/releases/download/v1.0/revolutioncase.rar) along with the dissertation and the script to run a End-to-End Test and understand the Tool's Workflow.  
Soon a more complete and concise tutorial will be available in english language.  
Sorry for the incovenience!

## Caveats
- For now, only the PostgreSQL database is supported
- We performed experiments using copies of real databases, but we strongly recommend that you set up a sandbox environment in order to validate the results. We also reinforce
that we did not stress all industrial use cases. So use it carefully.
